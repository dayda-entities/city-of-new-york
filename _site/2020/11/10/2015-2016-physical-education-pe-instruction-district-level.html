<h3>2015-2016 Physical Education - PE Instruction - District Level</h3>
<p><p>Background, Methodology:</p>

<p>Local Law 102 enacted in 2015 requires the Department of Education of the New York City School District to submit to the Council an annual report concerning physical education for the prior school year.</p>

<p>This report provides information about average frequency and average total minutes per week of physical education as defined in Local Law 102 as reported through the 2015-2016 STARS database. It is important to note that schools self-report their scheduling information in STARS. The report also includes information regarding the number and ratio of certified physical education instructors and designated physical education instructional space.</p>

<p>This report consists of six tabs:</p>

<ol>
  <li>PE Instruction Borough-Level</li>
  <li>PE Instruction District-Level</li>
  <li>PE Instruction School-Level</li>
  <li>Certified PE Teachers</li>
  <li>PE Space</li>
  <li>
    <p>Supplemental Programs</p>
  </li>
  <li>PE Instruction Borough-Level</li>
</ol>

<p>This tab includes the average frequency and average total minutes per week of physical education by borough, disaggregated by grade, race and ethnicity, gender, special education status and English language learner status. This report only includes students who were enrolled in the same school across all academic terms in the 2015-16 school year. Data on students with disabilities and English language learners are as of the end of the 2015-16 school year. Data on adaptive PE is based on individualized education programs (IEP) finalized on or before 05/31/2016.</p>

<ol>
  <li>PE Instruction District-Level</li>
</ol>

<p>This tab includes the average frequency and average total minutes per week of physical education by district, disaggregated by grade, race and ethnicity, gender, special education status and English language learner status. This report only includes students who were enrolled in the same school across all academic terms in the 2015-16 school year. Data on students with disabilities and English language learners are as of the end of the 2015-16 school year. Data on adaptive PE is based on individualized education programs (IEP) finalized on or before 05/31/2016.</p>

<ol>
  <li>PE Instruction School-Level</li>
</ol>

<p>This tab includes the average frequency and average total minutes per week of physical education by school, disaggregated by grade, race and ethnicity, gender, special education status and English language learner status. This report only includes students who were enrolled in the same school across all academic terms in the 2015-16 school year. Data on students with disabilities and English language learners are as of the end of the 2015-16 school year. Data on adaptive PE is based on individualized education programs (IEP) finalized on or before 05/31/2016.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Certified PE Teachers</li>
</ol>

<p>This tab provides the number of designated full-time and part-time physical education certified instructors. Does not include elementary, early childhood and K-8 physical education teachers that provide physical education instruction under a common branches license. Also includes ratio of full time instructors teaching in a physical education license to students by school. Data reported is for the 2015-2016 school year as of 10/31/2015.</p>

<ol>
  <li>PE Space</li>
</ol>

<p>This tab provides information on all designated indoor, outdoor and off-site spaces used by the school for physical education as reported through the Principal Annual Space Survey and the Outdoor Yard Report. It is important to note that information on each room category is self-reported by principals, and principals determine how each room is classified. Data captures if the PE space is co-located, used by another school or used for another purpose. Includes gyms, athletic fields, auxiliary exercise spaces, dance rooms, field houses, multipurpose spaces, outdoor yards, off-site locations, playrooms, swimming pools and weight rooms as designated PE Space.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Supplemental Programs</li>
</ol>

<p>This tab provides information on the department’s supplemental physical education</p>
