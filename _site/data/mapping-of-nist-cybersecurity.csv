1,Wireless Signals are Jammed to Disrupt Monitoring and Control,"A threat agent uses a wireless signal jammer to disrupt wireless communications channels used to monitor and control distribution systems and substations. Examples are wireless local area network (LAN) communications for intersubstation differential protection, wireless communications between a distribution management system (DMS) and static VAR compensators (SVC), and communications to wireless monitoring equipment",V1A) System relies on communications that are easy to jam in physical radio frequency (RF) communications. Physical radio frequency (RF) communications are subject to deliberate jamming since few radio systems outside of the military have anti-jamming capability. Sustained jamming is less effective than intermittent jamming with the latter potentially causing the system to execute inappropriate or out of order commands,I1A) Reduced situational awareness and impaired ability to react to fluctuations in load and apply controlled remedies such as switching capacitor banks and triggering voltage regulators. This could cause voltage adjustment inefficiencies resulting in voltage sags and swells that can trigger unwanted over and under voltage trips on feeders or in substations,"M1A) Require spread-spectrum radios, with channel-hopping or switch to alternate
communication paths. Examples include:

2,Shared Communications Leveraged to Disrupt DMS Communications,"Some utilities depend upon communication providers for long-haul and wide area network (WAN) communications for monitoring and control of their distribution system. Furthermore, utilities that provide their own communication network for critical functions often resell unused bandwidth to offset costs while others have spun off their communication network as a separate communications company. There is also a general trend toward economizing communications costs by sharing them. A threat agent could take advantage of these paradigms by compromising computer systems using the same network as the Distribution Management System (DMS) to facilitate a distributed denial of service attack through the infected computer system by means of a botnet centered on IP spoofing and Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) flooding. With the network overburdened, monitoring and control functions could become unavailable for optimization or protection",V2A) Communication channels are shared between different system owners that may reduce availability and reliability of entities or functions that rely on those channels. Attackers have demonstrated flooding attacks against communications paths up to optical carrier (OC) 48. These optical fiber connections carry 2400+ megabits per second and are typically used in regional Internet Service Provider networks,"I2A) Reduced situational awareness and impaired ability to react to fluctuations in
load and apply controlled remedies such as switching capacitor banks and triggering voltage regulators. This could cause voltage adjustment inefficiencies resulting in voltage sags and swells that can trigger unwanted over and under
voltage trips on feeders or in substations",M2A) Verify personnel (service providers) to ensure their services are secure and reliable,"ID.SC-4: Suppliers and third-party partners are routinely assessed using audits, test results, or other forms of evaluations to confirm they are meeting their contractual obligations.

14,Power loss due to lack of serial communication authentication,"Serial communications to substations over phone lines often lack authentication of field devices, such as RTUs.

15,Threat Agent Causes Worker Electrocution via Remote Access to Distribution System,"A threat agent performs reconnaissance of utility maintenance operations to identify current or scheduled maintenance on distribution lines and equipment
performed by utility linemen. The threat agent gains access to selected elements of the utility DMS system - which includes all distribution automation systems and equipment
in control rooms, substations, and on pole tops - via remote connections. After gaining the required access, the threat agent energizes distribution lines or equipment that are
under maintenance by linemen to elicit injury or death by electrocution. The remote connections might be established using a variety of methods or combination ofmethods. These include but are not limited to: using a lost, stolen, or acquired utility linemen�s laptop to access the DMS directly; compromising an active remotemaintenance connection used for vendor DMS application maintenance; taking advantage of an accidental bridged connection to the internet due to DMS misconfiguration; or subverting distribution control communications directly",V15A) Critical operations are not locked out during maintenance (automation system actions),I15A) Maintenance personnel injury or death,M15A) Define procedures that disallow remote DMS control actions on lines and equipment that are under maintenance,"PR.MA-2: Remote maintenance of organizational assets is approved, logged, and performed in a manner that prevents unauthorized access

16,Threat agent compromises serial control link to substation,"The Telco/Commercial Service Provider (CSP) provides communications capability between the utility�s substation and headend/control center. Both wired and
wireless based interfaces may be involved depending on the particular utility standards and site-specific constraints. Wired-based communication links can be analog or digital leased lines, while wireless interfaces are typically radio, cellular or even satellite based. To establish the Telco/CSP end-to-end communications, a point of demarcation (Demarc) is provided where the local utility owned communications infrastructure interfaces the telco owned network infrastructure (Error! Reference source notound.). A knowledgeable threat agent can compromise the serial communications at the Demarc by intercepting and selectively modifying communicated data to masquerade as a user (man-in-the-middle) or replay attack, in which the threat agent captures control messages and subsequent retransmission with the intent of producing an unauthorized effect. This can potentially compromise both real-time (sometimes referred to as operational) traffic as well as non-real-time (sometimes referred to as non-operational) traffic. In the context of real-time data exchanges, the substation gateway or RTU in the substation or the SCADA Front End Processor (FEP) at the headend can be affected by manipulating command and control messages in the direction of the substation or information messages in the direction of the head end. In the case of non-operational data exchanges, IED settings can be potentially manipulated",V16A) Physical access may be obtained by unauthorized individuals to the utility or Telco/ISP,"I16A) Loss of customer power, possibly to critical customers (e.g., hospital)","M16A) Implement approved cryptographic algorithms to protect the integrity of
