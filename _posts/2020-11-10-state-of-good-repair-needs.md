This dataset contains information for a select number of agencies, showing the Capital funding planned  to address state of good repair needs of their capital assets. Amounts are in dollars which, when summed and rounded to the nearest thousand by Agency, match the Asset Management Agency Reconciliation publication. The dataset is updated once a year.
