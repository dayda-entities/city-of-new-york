License tobacco wholesale/distributors dealers

New York City issues one license to act as a wholesale dealer in cigarette and / or other tobacco products.  New York City wholesale dealers of other tobacco products must have a state tobacco products wholesale license to be eligible for a city tobacco products wholesale license. A tobacco retail dealer who purchases or imports other tobacco products directly from manufacturers or out-of-state distributors must obtain a New York City wholesale dealer license for other tobacco products and remit the NYC OPT tax.
