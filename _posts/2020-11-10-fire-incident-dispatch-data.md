The Fire Incident Dispatch Data file contains data that is generated by the Starfire Computer Aided Dispatch System. The data spans from the time the incident is created in the system to the time the incident is closed in the system.  It covers information about the incident as it relates to the assignment of resources and the Fire Departmentâ€™s response to the emergency. To protect personal identifying information in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), specific locations of incidents are not included and have been aggregated to a higher level of detail.
