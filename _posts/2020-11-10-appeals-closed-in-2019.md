A list of all appeals closed by the Civil Service Commission in 2019. This list includes both Civil Service Law Section 50 Disqualification Appeals and Civil Service Law Section 76 Disciplinary Appeals.

The expiration dates listed here may not account for any extensions that have been granted. In particular, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (“DCAS”) extended multiple lists set to expire in 2020 and these extensions are not reflected here. For further information on list expiration dates  you may wish to consult DCAS whose website you can access here: http://www.nyc.gov/dcas.
