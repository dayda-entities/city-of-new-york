This dataset contains information for a select number of agencies. It shows the estimated spending necessary to preserve the structural integrity for each of their fixed assets which meet the criteria for capital eligibility. The numbers can be summarized by Agency to match the Asset Management Executive Summary publication. Amounts are rounded to the nearest thousand. The dataset is updated once a year.
