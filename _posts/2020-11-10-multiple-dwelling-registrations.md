Pursuant to New York Cityâ€™s Housing Maintenance Code, the Department of Housing 
Preservation and Development (HPD) collects registration information from owners of 
residential rental units. Owners are required to register if they own residential buildings 
with three or more units or if they own one- or two-family homes and neither they nor 
members of their immediate family live there. Registrations are required upon taking 
ownership of a qualifying building, and once a year thereafter.
