During the Covid-19 response, the Mayors Office of Operations worked with several city agencies to deploy Interagency Ambassadors across NYC parks to educate patrons on social distancing. This dataset contains encounters and non-encounters during deployment recorded by these Interagency Ambassadors.

This is part of the NYC Parks Covid-19 Social Distancing and Enforcement Data Collection: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?Data-Collection_Data-Collection=NYC+Parks+Covid-19+Social+Distancing+and+Enforcement&q=nyc+parks+covid
