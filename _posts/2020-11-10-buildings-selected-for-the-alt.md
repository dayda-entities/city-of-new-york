Each year, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) designates severely distressed multiple dwellings for participation in the Alternative Enforcement Program (AEP). HPD is required by law to submit and post an annual summary report of all AEP buildings. This dataset includes all buildings selected for participation in the AEP and the current status of the building in the program.
