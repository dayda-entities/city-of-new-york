LinkNYC is a first-of-its-kind communications network that will bring the fastest available free public Wi-Fi to millions of New Yorkers, small businesses, and visitors. Built at no cost to taxpayers, the five-borough LinkNYC network will, through advertising proceeds, generate more than $500 million in revenue for the City over the initiative’s first 12 years. Granted a franchise by the City in 2014, CityBridge will administer construction of the LinkNYC network.
By replacing the aging network of public pay telephones with state-of-the-art Links, CityBridge will transform the physical streetscape, enhance New Yorkers’ access to information, and create new local jobs for the development, servicing and maintenance of the structures.
