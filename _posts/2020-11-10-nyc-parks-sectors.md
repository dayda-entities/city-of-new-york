District - One or more parks that are combined and generally align with New York City Community Boards. 

Sector - One or more Park Districts that are combined in order share resources for daily maintenance. 

Region - One or more Park Sectors that are combined and assigned a regional managers who provides high-level, strategic planning and support for Parks managers, including maximizing resources between Districts and Sectors.
