The Mayor’s Office of Contract Services oversees and certifies agency compliance with the applicable laws and regulations for franchises and concessions. In certain circumstances, franchises and concessions are also subject to the approval of the Franchise and Concession Review Committee (FCRC).

Franchises are grants of the right to occupy or to use the City’s inalienable property, such as streets or parks, for a public service, e.g., transportation or telecommunications.
Concessions are grants for the private use of city-owned property such as for food sales or recreational activity, with the City’s compensation typically tied to the concessionaire’s revenue. Concessions are also subject to the City's Concession Rules as codified in Title 12 of the Rules of the City of New York.
