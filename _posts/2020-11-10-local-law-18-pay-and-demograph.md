The Agency Report Table aggregates pay and employment characteristics in accordance with the requirements of Local Law 18 of 2019. The Table covers over 180,000 City employees and is a point-in-time snapshot of employees who were either active or on temporary leave (parental leave, military leave, illness, etc.) as of December 31st, 2018. To protect the privacy of employees, the sign “<5” is used instead of the actual number for groups of less than five (5) employees, in accordance with the Citywide Privacy Protection Policies and Protocols. 

The Pay and Demographics Report and the list of agencies included is available on the MODA Open Source Analytics Library (https://moda-nyc.github.io/Project-Library/projects/pay-and-demographics/).
