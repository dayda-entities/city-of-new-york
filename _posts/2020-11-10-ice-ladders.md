This dataset contains GPS coordinates for each ice ladder NYC Parks places around lakes and ponds. These ladders are intended for rescuing anyone who falls through the ice of a lake or pond during winter. Each record is an ice ladder location. Some locations have multiple ice ladders, which is shown in the LADDER_COUNT field. This dataset is updated annually before winter so maps can be included in borough snow manuals.
