Listing of all Senior Centers, Abuse Prevention Contracts, Home Care Contracts, Legal Services Contracts, NORC Contracts, Transportation Contracts, Case Mangement Contracts, Home Delivered Meal Contracts and  Caregiver Contracts in all five boroughs.</p>
The Department for the Aging (DFTA) provides a wide array of services specific to the elderly population of New York City.  To accomplish this, the department contracts out to organizations (mainly non-profit) to provide these services throughout the five boroughs.  The majority of the services provided are through our Neighborhood Senior Centers which provide free meals (mostly lunch, some breakfast and dinner meals) that meet nutritional standards defined by the FDA.  DFTA provides this data of our contracted agencies sorted by the contract servivce type.  The dataset contains the relevant information for the public to contact the agencies providing the services they may be seeking.  The data is limited in that the contract service type does not provide the full scope of services that are provided in detail.
