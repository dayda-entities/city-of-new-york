An index of pedestrian volumes tracking the long-term trends of neighborhood commercial corridors. Data is collected at 114 locations, including 100 on-street locations (primarily retail corridors), 13 East River and Harlem River bridge locations, and the Hudson River Greenway. Screenline sampling is conducted during May and September on the sidewalk, mid-block (or mid-bridge) on both sides of street where applicable. Pedestrian volumes at 50 sample locations around the City are combined to create the Pedestrian Volume Index for the Mayorâ€™s Management Report.
