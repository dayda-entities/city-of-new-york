This dataset represents amenities activated as a part of Cool It! NYC, a Citywide plan to increase the amount of cooling features available to the public during heat emergencies, particularly in neighborhoods that face the dangers of high heat. This is part of the Cool It! NYC 2020 Data Collection, which includes the following amenities:
  
Drinking Fountains: Indicates whether a drinking fountain is activated, not yet activated, broken, or under construction. 

Spray Showers: Indicates whether a spray shower installed before July 2020 is activated, not yet activated, broken, or under construction. At this time, spray showers are mapped to the middle of parks. 
 
Cooling Sites: To measure neighborhoods that are the most at risk during extreme heat, NYC Health and Columbia University developed the New York City Heat Vulnerability Index, or HVI. Parks used this data to direct new cooling elements to neighborhoods with HVIs of 4 and 5.
