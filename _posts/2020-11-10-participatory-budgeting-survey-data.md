Results of optional anonymous surveys of participatory budgeting participants. Survey data helps inform City Council outreach efforts for participatory budgeting. Surveys are completed either online or in person on paper, after a person has participated. Please note that surveys collected in different years may have slightly different ranges of values. Depending on the year, this may be because the possible range of answers on the questionnaire were changed. Additionally, not all questions were asked in all years. Therefore, survey data is best compared within a survey year, not between survey years.
