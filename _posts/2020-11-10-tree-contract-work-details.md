Tree Contract Work Details contains information related to work performed on specific tree work contracts. This dataset can be joined to the Forestry Work Orders dataset (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Forestry-Work-Orders/bdjm-n7q4) by joining work_order_id from Tree Contract Work Details to OBJECTID from Forestry Work Orders. There are many work_order_ids per single contract_number. Not all work orders in Forestry Work Orders are represented in this dataset because it is only used to track work on specific contracts.
