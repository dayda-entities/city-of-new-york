This dataset shows all active tow truck companies licensed by NYC Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) and the company's enrollment status in the Directed Accident Response Program (DARP) and/or the Rotation Tow Program (ROTOW). 

In New York City, licensed tow companies may tow vehicles without prior consent of the owner of the vehicle only under:

Directed Accident Towing Program (DARP): Tow of vehicles that have been involved in an accident and cannot safely be driven under their own power;

Rotation Tow Program (ROTOW): Tow of stolen vehicles that have been recovered or abandoned, and when a vehicle is parked inconsistently with posted instructions on private property.

A business may apply to participate in DARP and ROTOW after holding a Tow Truck Company license for more than one year.
