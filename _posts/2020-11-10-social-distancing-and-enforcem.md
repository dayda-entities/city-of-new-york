During the Covid-19 response, NYC Parks deployed staff from the Urban Parks Rangers and Parks Enforcement Patrol divisions across NYC parks to educate patrons on social distancing and enforce tresspassing violations when patrons are in closed areas of the park. This dataset contains encounters and non-encounter patrols recorded by these staff.
