This dataset contains premise based Certificates of Fitness (COF) granted by the Bureau of Fire Prevention. Due to public safety concerns, COF for hazardous materials have been withheld from this dataset. Non-premise based COF which may be held for multiple buildings by a single entity are not included in this dataset.
