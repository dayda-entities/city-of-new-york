This data tracks the blocks that have been planted through NYC Parksâ€™ street tree block planting program, a major component of the MillionTreesNYC initiative.  When a block planting is completed for specific street segment, all available and appropriate locations for street tree installation have been planted.  This dataset is based on the Citywide Street Centerline data.
