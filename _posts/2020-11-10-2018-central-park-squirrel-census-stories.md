The Squirrel Census (https://www.thesquirrelcensus.com/) is a multimedia science, design, and storytelling project focusing on the Eastern gray (Sciurus carolinensis). They count squirrels and present their findings to the public. 

This table contains stories, observations, and notes written on tally sheets by Squirrel Sighters during the Census. Individual stories have been tagged with common story themes, such as “squirrel experience,” “park experience,” “dogs,” “other animals,” “accidental poems,” and “squirrels acting odd.”
