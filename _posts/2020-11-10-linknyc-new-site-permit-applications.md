LinkNYC is replacing the Cityâ€™s outdated public telephones with a network of kiosks that provide free high-speed Wi-Fi, nationwide calling, a dedicated 911 button, charging ports for mobile devices, and access to selected websites. This dataset lists proposed new locations for LinkNYC kiosk that are currently open for public comment.  The dataset does not include payphones that are being replaced by Links.
