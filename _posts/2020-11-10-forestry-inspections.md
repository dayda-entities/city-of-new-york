Record of Forestry inspections for NYC Parks & Recreation. Inspections are initiated by a service request or internal process and may result in a work order. 

Inspections are used to record field observations.  ForMS 2.0 requires that Inspections can only be created from either a Tree Point or Planting Space based on the asset in question.  Inspection types vary depending on the inspector’s workflow: 
• level 1 (limited visual)
• level 2 (basic) 
• level 3 (advanced)
• Re-inspection
• Sidewalk Rating (Trees and Sidewalks Inspections)
• General – Planting Space (Street Tree Planting Inspections)

This dataset can be joined to the Forestry Tree Points dataset by joining TreePointGlobalID from Forestry Inspections to GLOBALID from Forestry Tree Points.
