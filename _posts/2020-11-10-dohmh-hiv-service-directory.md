This directory is for at-risk for HIV and eligible persons living with HIV in New York City seeking HIV medical and supportive services. The agencies and their listed programs receive CDC and Ryan White Part-A funding to provide: Targeted-Testing among Priority Populations, Food and Nutrition Services, Health Education and Risk Reduction Services, Harm Reduction Services, Legal Services, Mental Health Services, Case Management and Care Coordination Services, and Supportive Counseling Services. To be eligible to recieve these services, prospective clients must: 1)be HIV-positive; 2) have a total household income below 435% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) (this is the same as the income eligible guidelines for the New York State AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) and higher than the income eligiblity guidelines for Medicaid in New York State); and 3) reside in New York City or the counties of Westchester, Rockland, and Putnam. For providers, to make a referral, please contact the program directly using the information provided in the diretory (please be sure to call before directing clients to the program). When making a referral, you may also find it useful to talk to your client about executing a release of information form authorizing you to share confidential health and HIV-related information with another service provider in order to coordinate care (for more information, go to https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/aids/providers/forms/informedconsent.htm).
