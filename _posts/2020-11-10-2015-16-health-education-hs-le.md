Local Law 14 (2016) requires that the NYCDOE provide citywide health education data, disaggregated by community school district, city council district and each individual school  Reports district level data on the number of students that received a semester (one credit) of health instruction, as well as the number of June & August graduates meeting the HS health requirements for the 2015-16 school year.  Note students are not required to receive health instruction at any particular grade level in high school, only prior to graduating.  Values less than 100% do not necessarily imply that students graduated without meeting credit requirements. These values may indicate missing or incomplete historical transcript data.
