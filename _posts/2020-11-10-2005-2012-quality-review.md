The Quality Review is a two- or three-day school visit by experienced educators to each New York City school. During the review, the external evaluator visits classrooms, talks with school leaders, and uses a rubric to evaluate how well the school is organized to support student achievement. This dataset includes all of the Quality Review scores from 2005-2011.
