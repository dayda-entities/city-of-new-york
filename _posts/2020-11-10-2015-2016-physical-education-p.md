Local Law 102 enacted in 2015 requires the Department of Education of the New York City School District to submit to the Council an annual report concerning physical education for the prior school.  Includes the average frequency and average total minutes per week of physical education by school, aggregated by grade, race, ethnicity, gender, special education status and English Language Learner status.  This report only includes students who were enrolled in the same school across all academic terms in the 2015-16 school year.
