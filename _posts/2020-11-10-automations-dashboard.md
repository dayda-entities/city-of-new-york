Open Data is most useful when itâ€™s up-to-date. Over the past eight years, NYC Open Data has invested in dataset automation, so that data is updated without human intervention. 
As the demand for City data continues to increase, and new technologies continue to surface, our goal is to automate more data, at a faster rate. In the last few months we have been testing tools and processes that should bring us closer to achieving this goal. 
These efforts will lead to more reliable data, while allowing the Open Data Team and agency staff to work more efficiently. We plan to invest more time into testing new methods of automation, and have released a this dataset so anyone can track our progress on automations.
