Background, Methodology: 

Local Law 102 enacted in 2015 requires the Department of Education of the New York City School District to submit to the Council an annual report concerning physical education for the prior school year.


This report provides information about average frequency and average total minutes per week of physical education as defined in Local Law 102 as reported through the 2015-2016 STARS database. It is important to note that schools self-report their scheduling information in STARS. The report also includes information regarding the number and ratio of certified physical education instructors and designated physical education instructional space.


This report consists of six tabs:


1.    PE Instruction Borough-Level
2.    PE Instruction District-Level
3.    PE Instruction School-Level
4.    Certified PE Teachers
5.    PE Space
6. Supplemental Programs
