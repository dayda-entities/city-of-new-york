Local Law 174 enacted in 2016 requires the Department of Education of the New York City School District to submit to the Council an annual report concerning Career and Technical Education programs in New York city schools. 

This report provides information about Career and Technical Education (CTE) programs and students in CTE programs and CTE-designated high schools, as defined in Local Law 174 as reported through the 2018-2019 STARS database. CTE Designated High Schools are those in which all students are engaged in NYC DOE-approved CTE sequences of instruction that integrate rigorous academic study with workforce skills in specific career pathways. It is important to note that schools self-report their scheduling information in STARS. The report also includes information regarding the number and ratio of certified CTE instructors. 

This report consists of seven tabs:

1.   CTE Program Characteristics and Enrollment, including number of staff that attended a CTE PD
2.   Number and percentage of students at each high school in a CTE program
3.   Number and percentage of students in each Community School District in a CTE program
4.   CTE application and admission - CTE designated schools only
5.   Graduation rates - CTE designated schools only
6.   Graduation rates - CTE designated schools only (by Community School District)
7.   CTE Full-Time and Part-Time Teachers

"This tab includes the following information for each high school-level CTE program:
