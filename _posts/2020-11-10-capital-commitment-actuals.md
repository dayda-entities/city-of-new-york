This dataset contains agency summary level data for total and city funded capital commitment actuals.  The dollar amount fields are rounded to millions. Data are from FY 2002 and updated once a year after annual capital commitment numbers are final.  Usually, they are updated along with the adopted financial plan between October and December each year.
