This dataset captures Children's Play Areas (CPAs). CPAs are places within NYC Parks that have Play Units installed. Play Units are equipment designated for children. A single CPA is defined as a centroid (Point geometry) of a cluster of Play Units. While otherwise known as playgrounds, this term is deliberately avoided because Properties or subproperties named as 'playgrounds' may contain more than just Play Units (e.g., adult fitness equipment, basketball/handball courts, etc.), and may not contain Play Units at all.

For more background on this dataset, details about how it's derived, what you can learn from it (e.g. "is there a play area near me?"), how it can be joined with other Parks data (e.g., Properties), maps and analysis - please see:
