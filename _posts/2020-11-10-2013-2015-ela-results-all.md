Beginning in 2013, the NY State Education Department changed the exams to align them with common core. Results from exams from 2006 - 2012 can be found at this link http:\\schools.nyc.gov/NR/exeres/05289E74-2D81-4CC0-81F6-E1143E28F4c4,
frameless.htm   Results presented here include all students who sat for either the Math or ELA exam. On the NYSED website, results for "matched" students can be found. To account for participation changes across years and anticipate the importance
of year-to-year same-cohort comparisons for the Class of 2022, "matched" Math and ELA results were calculated to include 4th grade students who were tested in both the current and previous year and to include 5th â€“ 8th grade students who were tested
in all three years.  In order to comply with FERPA regulations on public reporting of education outcomes, rows with 5 or fewer students are suppressed. District 75 students are represented in ther home districts and boroughs for FY2013,  for FY2014 & 2015, they are not included and Charter schools are not included.
