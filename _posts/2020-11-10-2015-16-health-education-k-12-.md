Local Law 15 (2016) requires that NYCDOE provide citywide Health Education instructor data, disaggregated by commuunity school district, city council district, and individual school data.  Reports provide the number of licensed full-time and part-time instructors, the number of instructors assigned to teach at least one health education class, the number and percentage of instructors who received professional development training and the total number and percentage of instructors attending multiple sessions of professional development.   This report includes number of licensed health instructors for 2015-16 school year.  Counts of licensed health instructors represent all active, school-based teachers serving under an NYCDOE health license as of 10/31/2015.
