Local Law 15 (2016) requires that NYCDOE provide citywide Health Education instructor data, disaggregated by commuunity school district, city council district, and individual school data.  Report provides school level data on the number of teachers assigned to teach health in grades K - 12 in the 2015-16 school year.  Data is based on STARS scheduling data.  Teachers are considered to be health instructors if they were assigned to a health course with active students enrolled during 2015-16 school year. Please note, Health Education in grades K-5 can be taught by the elementary classroom teacher, which helps explain why the elementary grades have a much higher number of teachers assigned to teach health than the middle and high school grades.
