This is a list of all in-active venues which were once listed on the NYC HealthMap. In-active venues may have been re-activated and now posted on the NYC HealthMap and within the “NYC Condom Availability Program HIV Condom Distribution Locations OpenData publication ( https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/NYC-Condom-Availability-Program-HIV-condom-distrib/4kpn-sezh 
</p>
The NYC Condom Availability Program maintains a robust list of active venues where New York City (NYC) residents may access free safer sex products across all 5 boroughs of NYC. The active venue list can be found in OpenData by searching “Condoms” or using this hyperlink: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/NYC-Condom-Availability-Program-HIV-condom-distrib/4kpn-sezh
In accordance with NYC OpenData laws (https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/open-data-law/ ) DOHMH publishes this list of venues which are no longer actively listed on the NYC HealthMap.
There are a variety of reasons a venue would be removed from the NYC HealthMap:
(1) Venue closed or changed ownership
(2) Venue no longer wishes to be advertised to the public
(3) Venue no longer distributes free safer sex products
(4) Venue was removed from the NYC HealthMap because they did not re-confirming that free safer sex products are available – this could also happen temporarily. 
Data duplication w/ inactive sheet. There are many years of historical data available within this sheet. Users will notice that many of those rows are duplicates. There are many reasons behind this; chiefly because data is refreshed hourly within DOHMH systems—causing a long historic trail of updated data. 
This dataset does not represent all locations which received orders of free safer sex products from NYC DOHMH nor have the listed venues [locations] been endorsed by NYC DOHMH.
