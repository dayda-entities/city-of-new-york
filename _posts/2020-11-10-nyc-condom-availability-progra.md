This is a list of over 325 venues, across the five boroughs that actively distribute free safer sex products.  Product availability varies by venue. </p>
The NYC Condom Availability Program maintains a robust list of active venues where New York City (NYC) residents may access free safer sex products across all 5 boroughs of NYC. This list is updated through a variety of mechanisms supported by the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH). At minimum, different sub-sets of this dataset are updated monthly by several vetted DOHMH contracted agencies. Other subsets of this dataset are updated in real-time by NYC Safer Sex Portal users. This entire dataset is refreshed in OpenData on a daily basis.
This dataset shows where New York City residents can access NYC free safer sex products throughout the five boroughs. Each row represents pertinent information related to a single venue which distributes NYC safer sex products. 
This data is collected and maintained to populate the NYC HealthMap (https://a816-healthpsi.nyc.gov/NYCHealthMap/home/) and may be used by other safer sex product [condom/lubricant] locators or map publically available locations.
This dataset does not represent all locations which received orders of free safer sex products from NYC DOHMH nor have the listed venues [locations] been endorsed by NYC DOHMH. Furthermore, while the data is sourced from the NYC HealthMap there could be a lag between what is visible inside the HealthMap’s user interface and what is seen on OpenData. The NYC HealthMap is updated ~hourly while OpenData is updated daily. If there are data discrepancies between your export and what is seen inside OpenData’s “View Data” please clear your browsing history/cache and restart your browser.
