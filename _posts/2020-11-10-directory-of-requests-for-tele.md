This data provides information about client requests for telephonic interpretation for the year 2018, including languages requested each month, number of calls and length of calls. In accordance with local and state laws and federal regulations, the New York City Health Department provides access to language services, free of charge and upon request, to all New Yorkers and collects this data accordingly.
