The Hepatitis category in NYC <a href="https://a816-healthpsi.nyc.gov/NYCHealthMap">Health Map</a> provides a list of facilities for the public and service providers looking for prevention services, testing, and treatment for hepatitis B and C. Due to shared risk factors, people living with HIV should get the Hep B vaccine, and should get tested for both Hep B and C. The programs listed have been verified by the NYC DOHMH.

The Viral Hepatitis Program in the Bureau of Communicable Diseases contracts with organizations in the city to provide peer navigation and patient navigation for Hep B and C. These agencies and their hepatitis services are listed in the NYC Health Map for public use. The Hepatitis list also includes agencies contracted by the New York State Health Department to provide Hep C testing, care and treatment, and agencies participating in the Hep Free NYC network. This list is maintained in a database by Viral Hepatitis Program staff and is updated once a year. It does not capture all hepatitis B and C services available in New York City. The data is organized by service type, and each record represents a service offered at a single location. Hepatitis A vaccine information is kept separately in the Vaccines list managed by the Bureau of Immunizations.
