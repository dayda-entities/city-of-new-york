The Department of Buildings investigates and takes disciplinary action against construction professionals when their conduct violates standards set forth in the New York City Construction Codes. Actions may be taken against individuals who are accused of abusing filing privileges; violating laws, rules, and regulations; performing work that requires a license or registration without a license or registration.
