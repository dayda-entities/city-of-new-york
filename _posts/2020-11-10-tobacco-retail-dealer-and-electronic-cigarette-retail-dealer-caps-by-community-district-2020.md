This dataset shows the maximum number (cap) of Tobacco Retail Dealer and Electronic Cigarette Retail Dealer licenses allowed in each Community District, as well as the current number of active Tobacco Retail Dealer and Electronic Cigarette Retail Dealer licenses.

The City set caps (limits) on the number of Tobacco Retail Dealer and Electronic Cigarette Retail Dealer licenses in each Community District established under Chapter 69 of the New York City Charter. The caps are 50 percent of the number of active Tobacco Retail Dealer licenses on February 24, 2018 and 50 percent of the number of licenses issued for Electronic Cigarette Retail Dealer as of August 23, 2018. The cap for Tobacco Retail Dealers excludes pharmacies whose licenses permanently expire before January 1, 2019 when pharmacies and businesses that contain pharmacies can no longer sell cigarettes or other tobacco products in New York City.

The number of active licenses are grouped by borough and community district number. Each row of data represents one Community District's license cap and the number of active licenses at the time of the dataset's publication.

Businesses interested in applying for these licenses may use this dataset to determine if licenses are available in their Community District. Even if licenses are not available, businesses may be able to apply if they meet limited exceptions to the cap. Visit nyc.gov/dca for license requirements.
