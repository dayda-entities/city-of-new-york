These records are generated from the trip record submissions made by High Volume For-Hire Vehicle (FHV) bases. On August 14, 2018, Mayor de Blasio signed Local Law 149 of 2018, creating a new license category for TLC-licensed FHV businesses that currently dispatch or plan to dispatch more than 10,000 FHV trips in New York City per day under a single brand, trade, or operating name, referred to as High-Volume For-Hire Services (HVFHS). This law went into effect on Feb 1, 2019. Each row represents a single trip in a FHV dispatched by a high volume base in 2020.  The trip records include fields capturing the high volume license number, the pickup and drop-off date, time, and taxi zone location ID, which correspond with the NYC Taxi Zones open dataset.
