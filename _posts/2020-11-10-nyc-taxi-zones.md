This map shows the NYC Taxi Zones, which correspond to the pickup and drop-off zones, or LocationIDs, included in the Yellow, Green, and FHV Trip Records published to Open Data.  The taxi zones are roughly based on NYC Department of City Planningâ€™s Neighborhood Tabulation Areas (NTAs) and are meant to approximate neighborhoods, so you can see which neighborhood a passenger was picked up in, and which neighborhood they were dropped off in.
