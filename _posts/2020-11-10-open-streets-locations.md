New York City is opening streets daily for pedestrians and cyclists to use the roadbed of the street for social distancing during the COVID-19 crisis. 
</p>
New York City is opening 40 miles of streets to allow for greater social distancing during the COVID-19 crisis, with a plan to expand to a total of 100 miles. The streets are open daily from 8am-8pm (otherwise noted) for pedestrians and cyclists to use the roadbed of the streets while maintaining at least six feet of distance from others. The Open Streets initiative is a collaboration between the Mayor's office, NYC Council, NYPD, Parks, NYC DOT, Business Improvement Districts (BIDs) and local community organizations. Please visit NYC DOT website for more information. https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pedestrians/openstreets.shtml
