This dataset contains information about NYCHA residents who took <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/dcas/employment/take-an-exam.page">Civil Service</a> exams, which assess a candidate’s qualifications for a particular Civil Service title in order to ensure that the hiring process is competitive and fair. Using a list of NYCHA addresses, DCAS performed a data match with individuals who took Civil Service exams. Each row in the dataset represents the number of public housing residents who took a civil service exam, disaggregated by the NYCHA development in which the test taker resides.

The dataset is part of the annual report compiled by the Mayor’s Office of Operations as mandated by the <a href="https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=2745761&GUID=2A9FB1D2-A1A8-4484-9D49-6F8332171B66">Local Law 163 of 2016</a> on different services provided to NYCHA residents.
