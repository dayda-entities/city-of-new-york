The Zoning Tax Lot Database is a comma–separated values (CSV) file format that contains up-to-date zoning by parcel. The Database includes the zoning designations and zoning map associated with a specific tax block and lot. The Database is updated on a monthly basis to reflect rezoning and corrections to the file.
