New York City’s comprehensive effort to reduce or eliminate potential losses from the hazards described in the Hazard Specific section of the website. The map includes existing and completed mitigation actions that will minimize the effects of a hazard event on New York City’s population, economy, property, building stock, and infrastructure. It is the result of a coordinated effort by 46 New York City agencies and partners to develop and implement a broad range of inventive and effective ways to mitigate hazards. Point, line, polygon features and a table for the Mitigation Actions map on the Hazard Mitigation website: www.nychazardmitigation.com/all-hazards/mitigation/actions-map/

NOTE: This table can be joined to the mapped projects using the HMP Index field.
