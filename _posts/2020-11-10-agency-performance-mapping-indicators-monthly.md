This dataset provides key performance indicators for several agencies disaggregated by community district, police precinct, borough or school district. Each line of data indicates the relevant agency, the indicator, the type of geographic subunit and number, and data for each month. Data are provided from Fiscal Year 2011 (July 2010) to Fiscal Year 2019 (June 2019). This data is submitted by the relevant agency to the Mayor’s Office of Operations on an annual basis and is available on Operations’ <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/cpr/agency-performance/agency-performance-reports.page">website</a>.
