These data were reported to the NYC DOHMH by June 30, 2014

This dataset includes data on new diagnoses of HIV and AIDS in NYC for the calendar years 2010 through 2013. Reported cases and case rates (per 100,000 population) are stratified by age group, race/ethnicity, and United Hospital Fund (UHF) neighborhood. For more information, please visit the HIV/AIDS Surveillance Data module on EpiQuery: nyc.gov/health/epiquery


Note: 
- Rates marked "NA" cannot be calculated because the underlying population size is unknown. 
- Tables or charts may contain suppressed data: cells representing 1-5 person(s) with an underlying denominator of <500 persons, or non-zero cells witha  denominator <=100 as per Intercensal 2014 estimates, are marked with an asterisk (*)
