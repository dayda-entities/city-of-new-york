The New York State calculation method was first adopted for the Cohort of 2001 (Class 2005). The cohort consists of al students who first entered 9th grade in a given school year (e.g., the cohort of 2006 entered 9th grade in 2006-2007 school year). Graduates are defined as those students earning either a local or regents diploma and exclude those earning either a special education (IEP) diploma for GED. 
"The NYSED defined English/Math Aspirational Performance Measure (APM) is the ercentage of students that after their fourth year in high school have met NYSED standards:
  Graduated by August with a Regents or Local diploma, AND
  Earned a 75 or higher on the English Regents, AND
  Earned an 80 or higher on one Math Regents."
In order to comply with FERPA regulations on public reporting of education outcomes, rows with a cohort of 20 or fewer students are suppressed. Due to small number of students identified as Native American or Multi-Racial these ethnicities are not reported on the Ethnicity tab, however these students are included in the counts on all other tabs.
