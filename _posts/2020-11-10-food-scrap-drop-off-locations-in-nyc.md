Locations where NYC residents can drop off their food scraps to be composted. Please note that starting on March 20, 2020, DSNY suspended some services to limit person-to-person contact and to enable our workforce to refocus on core operations. Suspended services include Food Scrap Drop-off sites which will be closed until further notice. Residents should not leave food scraps at any location. Visit https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/site/services/food-scraps-and-yard-waste-page/nyc-food-scrap-drop-off-locations for updates.
