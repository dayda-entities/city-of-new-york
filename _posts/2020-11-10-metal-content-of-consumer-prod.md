New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene tests consumer products, those collected during investigations of lead poisonings and store surveys, for lead. Certain consumer products are also tested for other metals such as arsenic and mercury.  This dataset contains the laboratory results for the consumer products that are tested.  For more information on hazardous consumer products, visit nyc.gov/hazardousproducts.</p>

Health department staff collects information as it appears on product labels or as reported to staff during investigations.  Factors such as language barriers and terminology variations may result in misspellings in some of the data fields.  Also, there are many variables that may affect the amount of metal found in a consumer product.  Variations in product ingredients and manufacturing processes may result in different metal concentrations found within a given product.  Therefore, results are representative of only the tested samples at the time they were tested. The data does not reflect any changes to the product that may have been made since the date of testing.
