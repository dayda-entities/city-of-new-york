The Bicycle Access to Office Buildings Law aims to increase bicycle commuting by providing cyclists with the opportunity to securely park their bicycles in or close to their workplaces. The law allows tenants to request for access from landlords in commercial buildings, and for DOT to monitor the requests for access and their status.
