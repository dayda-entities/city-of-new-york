New York City Department of Education 2016 - 2017 Career Technical Education Report.
Local Law 174 enacted in 2016 requires the Department of Education of the New York City School District to submit to the Council an annual report concerning Career and Technical Education programs in New York city schools. 

This report provides information about Career and Technical Education (CTE) programs and students in CTE programs and CTE-designated high schools, as defined in Local Law 174 as reported through the 2016-2017 STARS database. It is important to note that schools self-report their scheduling information in STARS. The report also includes information regarding the number and ratio of certified CTE instructors.
