Summary results from NYC Community Health Survey 2010-2016: adults ages 18 years and older 
Source: NYC Community Health Survey (CHS) 2010-16.
The Community Health Survey (CHS) includes self-reported data from adults, years 18 and older. CHS has included adults with landline phones since 2002 and, starting in 2009, also has included adults who can be reached by cell-phone. 
Starting in 2011, CHS weighting methods were updated to use Census 2010 and additional demographic characteristics (http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/epi/epiresearch-chsmethods.pdf ). 

Data are age-adjusted to the US 2000 Standard Population.	
Data prepared by Bureau of Epidemiology Services, New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene

The New York City Community Health Survey (CHS) is a telephone survey conducted annually by the DOHMH, Division of Epidemiology, Bureau of Epidemiology Services. CHS provides robust data on the health of New Yorkers, including neighborhood, borough, and citywide estimates on a broad range of chronic diseases and behavioral risk factors. The data are analyzed and disseminated to influence health program decisions, and increase the understanding of the relationship between health behavior and health status. For more information see EpiQuery, https://a816-healthpsi.nyc.gov/epiquery/CHS/CHSXIndex.html

"TARGET POPULATION 
The target population of the CHS includes non-institutionalized adults aged 18 and older who live in a household with a landline telephone in New York City (the five borough area). Starting in 2009, adults living in households with only cell phones have also been included in the survey.

HEALTH TOPICS 
Most years the CHS includes approximately 125 questions, covering the following health topics: general health status and mental health, health care access, cardiovascular health, diabetes, asthma, immunizations, nutrition and physical activity, smoking, HIV, sexual behavior, alcohol consumption, cancer screening and other health topics. A core group of demographics variables are included every year to facilitate weighting and comparisons among different groups of New Yorkers.

SAMPLING 
The CHS uses a stratified random sample to produce neighborhood and citywide estimates. Neighborhoods are defined using the United Hospital Fund's (UHF) neighborhood designation, which assigns neighborhood based on the ZIP code of the respondent. New ZIP codes have been added since the UHF's were originally defined. There are 42 UHF neighborhoods in NYC. However, to avoid small sample sizes for CHS estimates, UHF estimates are generally collapsed into 34 UHFs/groups.

Starting in 2009, a second sample consisting of cell-only households with New York City exchanges was added. This design is non-overlapping because in the cell-only sample, adults living in households with landline telephones were screened out.

A computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) system is used to collect the survey data. The CHS sampling frame was constructed with a list of telephone numbers provided by a commercial vendor. Upon agreement to participate in the survey, one adult is randomly selected from the household to complete the interview.

Interviewing is conducted in a variety of languages. Every year, the questionnaire is translated from English into Spanish, Russian, and Chinese. Some years, live translation services are provided by Language Line (including Hindi, Arabic, Farsi, and Haitian Creole). Typically, data collection begins in March of the study year and ends in December. The average length of the survey is 25 minutes.

LIMITATIONS 
The survey sampling methodology does not capture the following groups: households without any telephone service and (prior to 2009) households that only have a cell phone. The CHS also excludes adults living in institutional group housing, such as college dormitories.
