The Squirrel Census (https://www.thesquirrelcensus.com/) is a multimedia science, design, and storytelling project focusing on the Eastern gray (Sciurus carolinensis). They count squirrels and present their findings to the public. This dataset is the hectare grid that was used to divide Central Park for the 2018 Squirrel Census.
