• One line of data represents single syringe collection kiosk location, its capacity, how it is mounted, and when it was installed.
• Data is collected via an ArcGIS Online web application.
• Data is updated as necessary as kiosks are installed, moved, or removed. However, there is a delay between these actions happening and when the data is updated to reflect them.
• Only active kiosk locations are shown. Former kiosk locations have  been removed.
• The installation date is known to be incomplete. Minor shifts in kiosk locations do not typically entail the creation of a new record, rather the point is simply moved.
• Redundant values for the KioskType field have been removed.
