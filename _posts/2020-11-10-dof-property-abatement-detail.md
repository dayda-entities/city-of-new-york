Property tax abatement. 

The Department of Finance administers a number of benefits for property owners in the form of exemptions and abatement. Exemptions lower the amount of taxes you owe by reducing your property's assessed value. Abatement reduce your taxes by applying credits to the amount of taxes you owe.                           This dataset includes only abatement data and exemption data is stored as a separate dataset on this portal. The abatement data is reported at the parcel, condominium, and cooperative level. The maximum EXTRACTDT value displays the current abatement data. All other records contain historical abatement data.                                                                                          Only columns applicable to the abatement type are populated.
