Record of Forestry service requests for NYC Parks & Recreation. 

Two-way integration with 311 is maintained in ForMS 2.0.  Forestry related Service Requests (SRs) created by a 311 operator or submitted by the caller through either the 311 website, 311 phone app, or the Parks website stream into the system.  Conversely, updates are sent from ForMS 2.0 to 311 when SRs are actioned.

Service Requests can be created directly in ForMS 2.0, however, it is important to note that they will NOT receive a 311 SEIBEL number or be visible in 311.  Internally generated SRs should be used to track correspondence, commissioner, or other requests that do not originate from 311.
