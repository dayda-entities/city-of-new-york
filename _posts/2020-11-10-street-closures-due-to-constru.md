DOT Street Closure data identifies locations in the New York City Street Closure map where a street is subject to a full closure, restricting through traffic, for the purpose of conducting construction related activity on a City street. Details about DOT construction permits can be found at Street Works Manual, http://streetworksmanual.nyc/.  Full Closure Permits are issued for a period of time during which the street may be closed to through traffic for only a portion of the time, and open at other times.
