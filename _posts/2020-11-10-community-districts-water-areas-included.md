GIS data: Community Districts  (Water areas included)

Community Districts are mandated by the city charter to review and monitor quality of life issues for New York City (NYC) neighborhoods.  NYC is currently comprised of 59 community districts. The first byte is a borough code and the second and third bytes are the community district number. There are also 12 Joint Interest Areas (JIAs).  The JIAs are major parks and airports and are not contained within any community district.   This dataset is being provided by the Department of City Planning (DCP) for informational purposes only.
