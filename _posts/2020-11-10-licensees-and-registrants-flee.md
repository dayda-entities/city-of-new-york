Licensees and Registrants Fleet Information dataset contains information about active vehicles of approved BIC licensees and registrants. This data is partially collected from the application submitted to the commission by licensees and registrants. The majority of data points are collected from licensees and registrants via the Vehicle Management Portal. Business Integrity Commission maintains this dataset, updating it quarterly. Each row of data contains information about an active vehicle registered at BIC, including BIC plate number, vehicle year, vehicle model, vehicle make, engine year and so on.
