The Grant Applications Tracking Table tracks grant applications received by the LPC and their outcomes. 

LPC's Historic Preservation Grant Program (HPGP) offers grants ranging from $10,000 to $30,000 primarily for façade restoration to not-for-profit organizations and income-eligible owners of buildings located in historic districts, or are designated individual landmarks. The grants are funded through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG). The grant program looks favorably upon applicants that can, to the extent possible, provide matching funds. The Grant Applications Tracking Table tracks grant applications recieved by the LPC and their outcomes.
