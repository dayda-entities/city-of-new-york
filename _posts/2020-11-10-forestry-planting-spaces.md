Record of Forestry planting spaces for NYC Parks & Recreation. 

Tree Points and Planting Spaces form the basis of ForMS 2.0’s data inventory and are the core entities that all Service Requests, Inspections, and Work Orders are associated to.  The system has built-in rules to ensure that every Tree Point has a Planting Space and each Planting Space can have no more than one active Tree Point at a given time.  Locations that have had one tree removed and another tree replanted will appear in ForMS 2.0 as a single Planting Space associated with one retired Tree Point (that has a removal Work Order) and one active Tree Point.
