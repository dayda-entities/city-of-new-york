Record of Forestry planting spaces for NYC Parks & Recreation. 

Tree Points and Planting Spaces form the basis of ForMS 2.0â€™s data inventory and are the core entities that all Service Requests, Inspections, and Work Orders are associated to.  The system has built-in rules to ensure that every Tree Point has a Planting Space and each Planting Space can have no more than one active Tree Point at a given time.  Locations that have had one tree removed and another tree replanted will appear in ForMS 2.0 as a single Planting Space associated with one retired Tree Point (that has a removal Work Order) and one active Tree Point.
