On November 20, 2019, Mayor de Blasio signed into law LL199 of 2019, requiring the establishment of Commercial Waste Zones throughout New York City. The result of years of planning, analysis, and stakeholder engagement by DSNY, the Commercial Waste Zones (CWZ) program will create a safe and efficient commercial waste collection system that advances the Cityâ€™s Green New Deal and zero waste goals while providing high-quality, low-cost service to NYC businesses. For more information, see: https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/site/resources/reports/commercial-waste-zones-plan. </p>The zone map did change slightly after DSNY adopted final rules in February 2020: https://rules.cityofnewyork.us/sites/default/files/adopted_rules_pdf/cwz_map_final_rule_-_2-7-20_-_legal_10594369.pdf. The map presented here reflects the changes made when the final rules were adopted. Pre-COVID, DSNY was expecting to release the RFP for servicing the zones in May 2020 and enter into the long-term contracts in early 2021. With the enormous disruptions to commercial establishments and the carting industry from the pandemic and economic shutdown, the program is on an indefinite pause until the industry is able to start recovering and stabilizing.

The zones were adopted by final rules in February 2020. DSNY does not expect to change them for at least the ten year term of the commercial waste zone contracts. It would take a new rule making to change the boundaries.
