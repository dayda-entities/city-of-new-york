Property owners are required to obtain bedbug infestation history from tenants or a dwelling unit owner. This dataset captures the bedbug infestation history as reported by the property owner. 
</p>
Local Law 69 of 2017 requires that all multiple dwelling property owners must attempt to obtain the bed bug infestation history from the tenant or unit owner, including whether eradication measures were employed for a bedbug infestation.  The information reported in this file is self-reported information filed annually by property owners. Once the Bed Bug Annual Report has been filed, the property owner is required to either provide the filing receipt to each tenant (upon commencement of a new lease and with each lease renewal) OR post the filing receipt in a prominent location in the building. In addition, the property owner must either distribute to each tenant or post the DOHMH Preventing and Getting Rid of Bedbugs Safely guide, which provides information on the prevention, detection, and removal of bedbugs.  Each record in the file represents a filing completed. If a property has submitted two records for the same period, the second filing is the active final submission for the period.
