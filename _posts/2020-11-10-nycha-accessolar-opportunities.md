A list of sites available for solar PV development under NYCHA's ACCESSolar program.

As part of NYCHA's NextGeneration Sustainability Agenda, NYCHA has pledged to put 25 MW of solar power on its properties.  One of the avenues by which NYCHA aims to meet this goal is the ACcelerating Community Empowered Shared Solar (ACCESSolar) program, where smaller rooftops will be made available at low or no cost to community-based organizations and non-profits teaming up with solar developers.  The ACCESSolar program will help maximize the solar potential of NYCHAâ€™s portfolio.  NYCHA also aims for this program to provide green jobs to residents, expand the availability of solar power to LMI populations, and facilitate first projects for start-up developers.  ACCESSolar applicants will be able to submit an application online starting in late March 2018.

The ACCESSolar program was previously in development as Public Purpose Shared Solar (PPSS) and has been renamed to better reflect the program's goals.
