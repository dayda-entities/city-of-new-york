• One line of data represents the location of a canine waste bag dispenser, including what surface it is mounted on, who refills it, who made it, and when it was installed.
• Data is collected by analysts located in each borough and collated by Parks’ Innovation & Performance Management team.
• Data is updated as needed using an ArcGIS Online web application.
• Records for dispensers that are no longer active have been removed
• Not all records have an installation date. Records will only have an OMPPropID and SubProperty name if they fall within the bounds of a sub property.
