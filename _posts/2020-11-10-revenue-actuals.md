This dataset contains revenue category and revenue class summary level data for revenue actuals.  The dollar amount field is rounded to millions. Data are from FY 2002 and updated once a year after annual revenue numbers are final.  Usually, they are updated along with the first quarter financial plan between October and December each year.
