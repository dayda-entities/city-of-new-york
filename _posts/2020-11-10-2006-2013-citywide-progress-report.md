New York City Department of Education 2006 - 2013 Citywide Progress Report,
Progress Reports grade each school with an A, B, C, D, or F.  These reports focus on a school's learning environment, student performance, and student progress.  They were designed to help parents, teachers, principals, and others understand how well schools are doingâ€”and compare them to other, similar schools.
