These data are collected to inform families applying to Pre-K for All of the programs available.  This is a spreadsheet version of the exact data points printed in the borough-level directories and the online PDFs. Each record represents a school participating in Pre-K for All.  The information for each school is collected by the Department of Early Childhood Education (Department of Education).  The "Who Got Offers" section of the spreadsheet is calculated by the Office of Student Enrollment (Department of Education) based on results from Round 1 of the Fall 2017 admissions process. This spreadsheet is simply a different representation of the same material produced in the printed and widely distributed Pre-K directories. This spreadsheet should not be used to identify current programs, as the directory was printed in December 2017 and schools are subject to change.  For the most updated list of Pre-K for All schools, use the UPK Sites Directory compiled by the Department of Early Childhood Education.
