New York City Department of Education 2016 - 2017 Health Education Report.
Local Law 14 (2016) requires that the NYCDOE provide citywide Health Education data, disaggregated by community school district, city council district, and each individual school. Data reported in this report is from the 2016-17 school year.
This report provides information about the number and percent of students scheduled for at least one semester of health education as defined in Local Law 14 as reported through the STARS database. It is important to note that schools self-report their scheduling information in STARS.
