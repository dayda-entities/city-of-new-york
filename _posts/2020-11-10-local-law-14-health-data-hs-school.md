"""Local Law 14 (2016) requires that the NYCDOE provide citywide Health Education data, dis aggregated by community school district, city council district, and each individual school. Data reported in this report is from the 2015-16 school year.
""
This report provides information about the number and percent of students receiving one semester of health education as defined in Local Law 14 as reported through the 2015-2016 STARS database. It is important to note that schools self-report their scheduling information in STARS.

This report consists of 10 tabs:

1.   Health Education Standards
2.   HS - School 
3.   HS-District
4.   JS-City Council District
5.   MS-School
6.   MS-District
7.   Ms-City Council District
8.   Efficacy
9.  Compliance 
10. LGBTQ Inclusivity

Additionally, values less than 100% do not necessarily imply that students graduated without meeting credit requirements. In very rare cases, these values may indicate missing or incomplete historical transcript data.
