During the Covid-19 response, NYC Parks developed Social Distancing and Enforcement applications used by Parks and other city agencies. This dataset contains a comprehensive list of parks (or areas within a park) that can be selected in these applications.

This is part of the NYC Parks Covid-19 Social Distancing and Enforcement Data Collection: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?Data-Collection_Data-Collection=NYC+Parks+Covid-19+Social+Distancing+and+Enforcement&q=nyc+parks+covid
