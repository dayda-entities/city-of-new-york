The New York State calculation method was first adopted for the Cohort of 2001 (Class of 2005).  The cohort consists of all students who first entered 9th grade in a given school year (e.g., the Cohort of 2006 entered 9th grade in the school year).  Graduates are defined as those students earning either a Local or Regents diploma.
