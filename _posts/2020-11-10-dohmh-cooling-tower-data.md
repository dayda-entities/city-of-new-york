The dataset contains all current registrations of commissioned cooling towers in NYC. Cooling tower registration in NYC is mandated by Local Law 77 of 2015. Registration data are provided by building owners and managers of cooling towers. Each record represents an individual cooling tower. Decommissioned towers are not in the dataset. Operation and maintenance of Cooling Towers in NYC are ruled by Chapter 8 of the NYC Health Code. The accuracy of the data of cooling tower characteristics (commissioning date, building address, make, model, serial number and capacity) is responsibility of the person registering the equipment.
