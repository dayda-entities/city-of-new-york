This data set features a list of randomly generated dates used for auditing Process Servers required to complete DCA’s Monthly Compliance Report under a signed consent order. 

Some licensed process serving agencies agreed to a Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) consent order and must use DCA’s Monthly Compliance Report to comply with the review and report requirements. Each month, DCA posts a randomly generated audit date that these process serving agencies should use to answer Questions 30, 31, and 32, for every process server who served process on behalf of the agency during the previous month.

The dates are selected at random every month.

Each record in the dataset represents a calendar month.

If the process server did not serve on either the randomly generated audit date or the alternate date selected then responses to questions 30, 31, and 32 must be based on the last day of the month that the process server did serve process.
