Popular Baby Names by Sex and Ethnic Group
Data were collected through civil birth registration. Each record represents the ranking of a baby name in the order of frequency. Data can be used to represent the popularity of a name. Caution should be used when assessing the rank of a baby name if the frequency count is close to 10; the ranking may vary year to year.
