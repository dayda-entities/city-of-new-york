Health insurance enrollment and assistance with SNAP benefits (Food Stamps)

Data collected to promote health insurance enrollment among uninsured New Yorkers. Data collected manually. Each record represents a health center location where health insurance enrollment and assistance with SNAP benefits (Food Stamps) are offered. Data can be used by general public seeking assistance with signing up for health insurance or SNAP. Data may change as program needs are changed, e.g., opening of new site or change in hours of operation at a particular site.
