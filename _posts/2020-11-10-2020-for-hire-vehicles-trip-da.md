These records are generated from the For-Hire Vehicle (“FHV”) Trip Record submissions made by traditional livery, luxury, and black car bases. The FHV trip records include fields capturing the dispatching base license number and the pick-up date, time, and taxi zone location ID, which correspond with the NYC Taxi Zones open dataset. Each row represents a single trip in an FHV in 2020.
