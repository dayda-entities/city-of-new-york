This dataset contains a list of all inspections conducted and any associated violations at active, city-regulated, center-based child care programs and summer camps over the past 3 years. The violations are pre-adjudicated. Violations that are subject to potential penalties (fines) are submitted to NYC Office of Administrative Trials and Hearing where they are adjudicated as either sustained/upheld or dismissed. The dataset also contains additional information on the programs, including license information. For more information on child care in NYC visit: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/services/child-care.page.
