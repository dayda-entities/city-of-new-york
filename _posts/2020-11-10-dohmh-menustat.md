MenuStat.org is an interactive online database of nutrition and menu information from top national restaurant chains. Each item is coded a mutually exclusive food category and descriptive information is coded into binary variables (e.g. on the kids menu). A new year of data is added annually and individual menu items are linked over time with a unique ID, allowing for trend analyses. On MenuStat.org, menu items that can be ordered together as part of a customizable or combination meal are linked together by a unique ID (Customizable_Build_ID) and all data can be exported for further analyses. NYC DOHMH developed and maintains MenuStat, but it is hosted externally
