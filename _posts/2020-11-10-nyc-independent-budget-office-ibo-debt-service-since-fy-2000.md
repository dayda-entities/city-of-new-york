NOTES:
1Debt service is the cost to New York City of repaying its outstanding debt, including both principal and interest. The figures in the table have been adjusted to reflect debt service that was originally scheduled for payment in each year since 2000.
2By law, New York City is required to have a balanced annual budget. In years when it runs a surplus, the primary means the city uses to comply with this requirement is to use up some or all of the surplus by prepaying some of the subsequent yearsâ€™ debt service expenses. As a result, the cash outlay for debt service in a given year is not an accurate representation of the true cost of debt service in that year.

8TFA BARBs and TSASC are not included in OMB's or the Comptroller's definitions of New York City outstanding debt.  For an explanation of these items, and their inclusion in NYC IBO's definition of New York City outstanding debt, please see New Outstanding Debt. 
9In 2006, TSASC restructured its outstanding indebtedness. This included a one time expense of $161 million for redeeming all bonds issued under a secured loan agreement with the United States Department of Transportation, via the department's Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) program. Additionally, all prior year TSASC bond series were defeased, leaving only Series 2006-1 bonds outstanding.
10MWFA has defeased $14.8 billion of bonds as of June 30, 2012. IBO has not made adjustments to debt service presented in the table to reflect these actions.
