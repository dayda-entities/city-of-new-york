Local Law 14 (2016) requires that the NYCDOE provide citywide Health Education data, disaggregated by community school district, city council district and each individual school.  This reports provides information about the number and percent of students receiving one semester of health education as defined in local law 14 as reported through 2015-2016 STARS database.   It includes district level data on number of 6-8 graders that received a semester of health instruction as well as number of 8th graders meeting the middle school health requirements for 2015-16 school year.  This regulation does not require students to receive health instruction at any particular grade level in middle school, only prior to completing 8th grade and a student may advance without completing the course.
