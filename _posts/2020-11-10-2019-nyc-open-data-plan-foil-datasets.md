Local Law 7 of 2016 requires agencies to “review responses to freedom of
information law [FOIL] requests that include the release of data to determine
if such responses consist of or include public data sets that have not yet been
included on the single web portal or the inclusion” on the Open Data Portal.
Additionally, each City agency shall disclose “the total number, since the last
update, of such agency’s freedom of information law responses that included the
release of data, the total number of such responses determined to consist of or include
a public data set that had not yet been included on the single web portal and
the name of such public data set, where applicable, and the total number of such
responses that resulted in voluntarily disclosed information being made accessible
through the single web portal."
