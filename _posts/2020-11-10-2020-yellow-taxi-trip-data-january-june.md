These records are generated from the trip record submissions made by yellow taxi Technology Service Providers (TSPs). Each row represents a single trip in a yellow taxi in 2020.  The trip records include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts.
