Record of Forestry work orders for NYC Parks & Recreation. 

Work Orders are used to record activities performed by Parks staff, contractors, other Agencies, or private entities in the case of permitted work.  ForMS 2.0 requires that WOs can only be created from an Inspection, with the exception of a Debris Removal â€“ Misc.  Wood WO where the associated tree cannot always be determined.

This dataset can be joined to the Forestry Planting Spaces dataset by joining PlantingSpaceGlobalID from Forestry Work Orders to GLOBALID from Forestry Planting Spaces.
