This report provides data regarding students enrolled in New York City schools during the 2012-2013 school year, according to the guidelines set by Local Law 2011/042.
Consistent with other school-year reporting, these results include students enrolled and events that occurred between October 26, 2012 and July 1, 2013.  Prior to October 26th, 15,552 students transferred between New York City schools, 4,758 students were discharged outside of NYC schools, and 3,592 students dropped out or were discharged under other codes.
School level results represent all events for all students.  School level results are not presented for District 79 programs or YABCs.
All results exclude District 84.
Citywide, Borough, and District results represent the last discharge or transfer for each student.
32 students in grades six through eight and 147 students in grades nine through twelve enrolled in school at correctional facilities or detention programs during the 2012-13 school year. 
Pursuant to the legislation and in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), if a category contains between 0 and 9 students, the number has been replaced with a symbol.  In addition, certain numbers have been replaced with a symbol when they could reveal, through addition or subtraction of other numbers that have not been redacted, the underlying count of a number that has been redacted.  
Codes for dropouts and other accountable discharges include 02, 12, 21, 29, 35, and 39. In addition, codes 08X, 10X, and 11X are considered dropouts in order to align with state guidance. These codes reflect the subset of all discharges that indicate that a student has discontinued schooling without having obtained a diploma.
