About the Data
All NYC children are required to be tested for lead poisoning at around age 1 and age 2, and to be screened for risk of lead poisoning, and tested if at risk, up until age 6. These data are an indicator of the number and percentage of children turning 3 years old in a given year who were tested for lead poisoning. 
How calculated: To identify children tested for lead poisoning, birth records for all children born in New York City to New York City resident mothers, and turning 3 years old in a given year were matched to children tested for lead poisoning before age 3.
