New York City Department of Education 2016 - 2017 Computer Science Report ,
Local Law 177 enacted in 2016 requires the Department of Education of the New York City School District to submit to the Council an annual report concerning computer science education for the prior school year.    

This report provides information about the number of computer science programs offered and the number of students enrolled in those programs as defined in Local Law 177 as reported through the 2016-2017 STARS database. It is important to note that schools self-report their computer science course information in STARS. This report also includes information regarding the number and ratio of certified STEM instructors, the department's STEM Institute, the nature of the district's computer science initiatives and the total available bandwidth in each school.
