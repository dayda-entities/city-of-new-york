Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) eligible and ineligible census tracts. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development requires local municipalities that receive CDBG formula entitlement funds to use the 2011-2015 ACS LMISD data file to determine where CDBG funds may be used for activities that are available to all the residents in a particular area. A CD-eligible census tract refers to 2010 census tracts where the area is primarily residential and at least 51.0% of the residents are low- and moderate-income as per the LMISD data file. For New York City, a primarily residential area is defined as one where at least 50.0% of the total built floor area is residential as determined by PLUTO 18v2.1. Low- and moderate-income persons are defined as persons living in households with incomes below 80 percent of the area median household income (AMI). The New York Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area's AMI was $70,300 for a 4-person family at the release of the 2011-2015 American Community Survey.
