This dataset provides a breakdown of all the Service Categories that are provided, and funded by DYCD. For each Service Category, the datasets list their DYCD business unit (Program Area), sub-divisions (Program Types), the DYCD-funded organization (Provider) that provide their respective services, and finally, the Program Sites where these services are available.
