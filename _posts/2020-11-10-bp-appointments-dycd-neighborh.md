This dates set represents Borough President appointee DYCD (Neighborhood Advisory Board ). NABs serve Neighborhood Development Areas (NDAs), which are low-income neighborhoods designated as needing community development support. NAB members are responsible for helping to identify the needs of their local communities. DYCD takes their findings into consideration when allocating federal Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) funding.
