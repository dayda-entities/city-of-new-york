Street and sidewalk cleanliness ratings.

NOTE: Due to a software coding error thatâ€™s since been corrected, some cleanliness rating data between November 2018 and July 2019 was found to be incomplete, and citywide scores cannot be re-calculated at the level of confidence required to be included in scorecard open data set.
