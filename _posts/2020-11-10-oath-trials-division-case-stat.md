The OATH Trials Division dataset contains information about a diverse range of complex administrative law matters that are filed by city agencies, boards, and commissions and adjudicated by OATH Administrative Law Judges (ALJs) at the New York City Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings, Trials Division. 
 
Such matters include civil service disciplinary and disability cases, city contract disputes, license revocation proceedings, prevailing wage proceedings, discrimination cases, loft law proceedings, Krimstock cases, where car owners seek return of  vehicle seized during an arrest, campaign finance law and conflicts of interest law cases, alleged violations of consumer protection laws, and fair work week and paid sick leave laws.  
 
The Trials Division dataset includes those closed cases where litigants appear before the Trials Division for trial and where an OATH Administrative Law Judge has issued a decision. By law or by agency rule, the OATH ALJ issues final decisions in Krimstock cases, contract disputes and most cases brought by the Department of Consumer Affairs.  In all other cases, the OATH ALJ issues a recommended decision which is subject to final action and determination by the filing agency's Agency Head.  If an appeal is filed, the dataset provides the date of the appeal action that occurs after the final determination.
