Location and resolution of reported incidents of graffiti within NYC. The Graffiti-Free NYC Program removes graffiti and other blight across the five boroughs. Graffiti-Free NYC is a cooperative effort among the NYC Economic Development Corporation, the NYC Department of Sanitation, and the Office of the Mayor. For more info, see: https://www.nycedc.com/program/graffiti-free-nyc. The COVID-19 is having a significant impact on the Cityâ€™s economy and finances. As of April 21, 2020, to ensure the City can continue to devote resources to essential safety, health, shelter, and food security needs, the City suspended the Graffiti Free NYC program indefinitely. As a result, 311 has suspended processing of graffiti removal service requests.
