This dataset contains a list of City-owned spaces that are available and potentially suitable for community urban agricultural use, including community gardens and urban farms. This dataset is created and maintained as per Local Law 46 of 2018.  While this list is updated periodically, anyone seeking to use one of the listed sites for community urban agriculture should contact the agency that owns the site, and NYC Parks GreenThumb, to confirm the siteâ€™s current availability and suitability.
