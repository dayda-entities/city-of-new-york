The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) is an ongoing, population-based risk factor surveillance system designed to identify and monitor selected maternal experiences and behaviors that occur before, during, and shortly after pregnancy, among a stratified sample of mothers delivering a live birth. PRAMS is a partnership with the CDC and presently exists in 50 jurisdictions, including 47 states, New York City, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. In NYC, PRAMS participants are randomly selected from the Cityâ€™s birth certificate records (approximately 2,100 participants per year).
