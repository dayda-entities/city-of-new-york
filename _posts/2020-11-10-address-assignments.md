The borough president of each borough is responsible for assigning new addresses to new or significantly altered properties or buildings for the purpose of identification from the street and the delivery of mail. Vanity addresses are valid street addresses that take nearby landmarks or geographies into account instead of the street name where the building entrance is located. New addresses and vanity addresses are assigned by request by property owner or developer.
