The Squirrel Census (https://www.thesquirrelcensus.com/) is a multimedia science, design, and storytelling project focusing on the Eastern gray (Sciurus carolinensis). They count squirrels and present their findings to the public. This table contains environmental data related to each of the 350 “countable” hectares of Central Park. Examples include weather, litter, animals sighted, and human density.
