This dataset provides a machine-readable format for the data that populates the "NYC Free Tax Preparation Site Finder" map hosted on DCA's website.  The dataset includes the name and address of the service provider, its hours of operation, services available, and required geo-spacial data elements used by the map.

DCA's Office of Financial Empowerment (OFE) DCA coordinates the Cityâ€™s Annual Tax Season Initiative which offers free tax preparation services to qualifying New Yorkers. NYC Free Tax Prep sites are displayed on a map at nyc.gov/taxprep (https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dca/TaxMap/index.html)

The map is updated whenever a new site is added or an existing site changes its hours of operation or services provided.

For more information about Free Tax Preparation Sties visit the DCA website (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/dca/consumers/file-your-taxes-faqs.page).
