NYC Reported Dog Bites.

Information reported assists the Health Department to determine if the biting dog is healthy ten days after the person was bitten in order to avoid having the person bitten receive unnecessary rabies shots. Data is collected from reports received online, mail, fax or by phone to 311 or NYC DOHMH Animal Bite Unit. Each record represents a single dog bite incident.  Information on breed, age, gender and spayed or neutered status have not been verified by DOHMH and is listed only as reported to DOHMH.
