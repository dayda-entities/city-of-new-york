Dataset contains information on rat inspections.

Rat Information Portal Data Release Notes        April 20, 2015

The Rat Information Portal (RIP) is a web-based mapping application where users can view rat inspection data. 

Data sources: NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), Division of Environmental Health Pest Control Database

Notes on data limitations: Please note that if a property/taxlot does not appear in the file, that does not indicate an absence of rats - rather just that it has not been inspected. Similarly, neighborhoods with higher rates of active rat signs may not actually have higher rat populations but simply have more inspections.
