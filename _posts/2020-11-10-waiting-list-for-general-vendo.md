A General Vendor license is required to sell, lease or offer to sell or lease goods or services in a public place that is not a store. The maximum number of General Vendor licenses that DCA issues to non-veterans is limited by law to 853. DCA maintains a waiting list, which is currently closed, and calls applicants in the order of the randomly assigned priority numbers.
