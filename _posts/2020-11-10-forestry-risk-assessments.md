Risk Assessments are sub-components of Inspection records where Type = Level 2. Trees are inspected in accordance with Parks' Tree Risk Management program. For a given defect identified on a tree, 3 rating variables are selected to arrive at a Total Rating. Because multiple defects can be noted on a tree, multiple Risk Assessment records can be related to one Inspection.
