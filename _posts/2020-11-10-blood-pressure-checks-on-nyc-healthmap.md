The dataset includes locations in NYC that offer free blood pressure checks at self-serve blood pressure kiosks or by pharmacy staff. 
</p>
Blood pressure check data collected to promote access to free blood pressure checks throughout NYC. Data collected so users can visit the NYC HealthMap online to find locations nearest to them to check their blood pressure at a self-serve kiosk or by pharmacy staff. Data collected manually. Each record represents a location that offers free blood pressure checks. Data can be used by general public seeking places to check their blood pressure. Data may change as sites are added and/or sites inform us of updates (i.e. address changes, pharmacy closures)
