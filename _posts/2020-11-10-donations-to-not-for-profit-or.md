Donations to Not-for-Profit Organizations Affiliated with Elected Officials.

This data is collected pursuant to Chapter 9 of Title 3 of the New York City Administrative Code and the Rules of the Conflicts of Interest Board established thereto.  These laws require an affiliated organization to disclose all donations of $5,000 or more received by the organization within a calendar year.  The previous calendar year's donations must be reported to the Board by August 1.  The data is submitted through the Board's reporting portal and can be searched on that portal.  All information is presented as submitted by the affiliated organization and is not standardized or corrected by Conflicts of Interest Board staff.
