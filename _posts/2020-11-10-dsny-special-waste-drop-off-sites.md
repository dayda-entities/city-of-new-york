Location of DSNY Special Waste Drop-Off Sites. Please note that starting on March 20, 2020, DSNY suspended some services to limit person-to-person contact and to enable our workforce to refocus on core operations. Suspended services include Special Waste Drop-off sites which will be closed until further notice. Residents should not illegally dump waste at these locations. Visit https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/site/services/harmful-products for updates.
