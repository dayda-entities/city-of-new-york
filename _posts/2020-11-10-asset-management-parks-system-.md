This table is the primary table for information about work orders, and contains general information - including a description of the work, assigned title, request date and completion date -  about each work order. Each row represents a single work order. The primary key field is EVT_CODE. The EVT_OBJECT field can be joined to the Assets table on OBJ_CODE to know which asset the work order was for.
