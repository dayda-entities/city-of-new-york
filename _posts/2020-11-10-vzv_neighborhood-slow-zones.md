The Neighborhood Slow Zone program is an application based program which takes a neighborhood area and reduces the speed limit to 20 mph. Areas are chosen based on crashes, presence of schools and other neighborhood amenities, and community support. The treatments include a mixture of markings, signage, and speed humps.
