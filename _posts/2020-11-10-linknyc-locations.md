LinkNYC is replacing the Cityâ€™s outdated public telephones with a network of kiosks that provide free high-speed Wi-Fi, nationwide calling, a dedicated 911 button, charging ports for mobile devices, and access to selected websites. This dataset lists locations where a LinkNYC kiosk has been installed, including sites that have replaced public pay telephones (PPT) and new sites that have been reviewed by community and elected officials.  The Project Status field indicates whether the Link is already active or is still in the process of being connected to electric power and telecommunications fiber.
