Locations where NYC residents can drop off their leaves to be composted. For more information, see: https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/site/services/food-scraps-and-yard-waste-page/community-leaf-drop-off. Please note that effective April 2, 2020, community gardens on NYC Parks property may remain open or closed to garden members only at the discretion of each garden group, and only for necessary maintenance and season preparation. Due to the relatively small spaces in most gardens and the difficulty in achieving safe social distancing of 6 feet or more, gardens must remain closed to the general public. For more info, see: https://greenthumb.nycgovparks.org/news.html?news_id=468
