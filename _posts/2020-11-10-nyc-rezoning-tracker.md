Pursuant to Local Law 175 of 2016, the City is responsible for publishing a list of capital and programmatic commitments associated with neighborhood-scale rezonings, and an annual progress report detailing the status of each initiative. These rezoning commitments are the product of comprehensive and community-driven planning processes in each neighborhood (East New York; Greater East Midtown; Downtown Far Rockaway; East Harlem; Jerome Avenue; and Inwood) and have been organized by policy domain (Housing; Open Space; Community Resources; Transportation; and Economic and Workforce Development).
