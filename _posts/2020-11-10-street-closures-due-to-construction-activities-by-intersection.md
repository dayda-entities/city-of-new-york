DOT Street Closure data identifies locations in the New York City Street Closure map where a street is subject to a full closure, restricting through traffic, for the purpose of conducting construction related activity on a City street. Details about DOT construction permits can be found at Street Works Manual, http://streetworksmanual.nyc/.  Full Closure Permits are issued for a period of time during which the street may be closed to through traffic for only a portion of the time, and open at other times.

Additional information regarding which part of the street and during which period of time it is fully closed is included only on the permit itself.
