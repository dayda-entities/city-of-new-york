DOB NOW: BUILD is an online portal that allows users to file for permit applications, check the status of an application, make payments, schedule appointments, and print permits.

This dataset contains general information about the job filing, including location, applicant, type of work and fee information. Each instance of elevator work might have one row/record for the Initial application, as well as one or more Post Approval Amendment. (See Filing_Type field.)
