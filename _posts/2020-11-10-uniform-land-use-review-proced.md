List of the Borough President's Recommendations on ULURP applications in Brooklyn.

Each Borough President has a role in the ULURP process, as stipulated in the New York City Charter. The Borough President reviews each ULURP application in Brooklyn and provides policy recommendations to the City Planning Commission and the City Council. This data set indicates his recommendations for all applications reviewed during his term in office. Each record corresponds to a separate application, and provides the following information: the application name, the application's ULURP number(s), the affected Community Board(s), the affected Council District (s), the recommendation date, and the nature of the Borough President's recommendation. This dataset also provides access to the PDF document of the complete recommendation. This data can be used by the public to learn about recent land use proposals across the Borough, as well as specific community boards.
