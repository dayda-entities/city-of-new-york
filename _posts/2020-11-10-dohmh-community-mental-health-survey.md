The New York City Community Mental Health Survey (CMHS) was a one-time telephone survey conducted by the DOHMH.  The CMHS was conducted in conjunction with the annual 2012 Community health Survey (CHS). The CMHS provides robust data on the mental health of New Yorkers, including neighborhood, borough, and citywide estimates. The data are analyzed and disseminated to influence mental health program decisions, and increase the understanding of the mental health among New Yorkers.
