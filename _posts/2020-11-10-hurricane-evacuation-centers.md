This dataset shows hurricane evacuation centers. Persons requiring shelter during a hurricane are processed at a
hurricane evacuation center and then transported to a hurricane shelter. In the event of a hurricane, the status of these hurricane evacuation centers should be confirmed at www.nyc.gov or by calling 311.
