Population Numbers By New York City Neighborhood Tabulation Areas

The data was collected from Census Bureaus' Decennial data dissemination (SF1). 
Neighborhood Tabulation Areas (NTAs), are aggregations of census tracts that are subsets of New York City's 55 Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs). Primarily due to these constraints, NTA boundaries and their associated names may not definitively represent neighborhoods. 
This report shows change in population from 2000 to 2010 for each NTA.
Compiled by the Population Division â€“ New York City Department of City Planning.
