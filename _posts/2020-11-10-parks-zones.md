Larger NYC parks (generally >20 acres) are subdivided into smaller sections that make inspecting these parks feasible and efficient.  These sections are called "zones."   The size and boundaries usually conform to one or more of the following criteria:  Zones should be inspectable in 1-2 hours; zone boundaries should follow the park’s features (paths, tree lines, etc) whenever possible; and/or conform to pre-existing boundaries used to divide the park for maintenance; and/or define a cohesive area within the park (ballfields, wooded areas, etc).  Besides zones, this layer contains a handful of Sitting Areas that are part of larger parks but could not be defined as zones due to their smaller size.
