The Daily Fleet Service Report provides information on overall vehicle availability for all agencies within the City fleet, including the "DCAS Managed" fleet, which serves a number of Mayoral agencies.  It also includes the Critical Fleet Summary, which tracks availability of vehicles assigned to key programs or functions, as well as availability of seasonal vehicles.
