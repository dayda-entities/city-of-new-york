This data dictionary describes High Volume FHV trip data. Each row represents a single trip in an FHV dispatched by one of NYCâ€™s licensed High Volume FHV bases. On August 14, 2018, Mayor de Blasio signed Local Law 149 of 2018, creating a new license category for TLC-licensed FHV businesses that currently dispatch or plan to dispatch more than 10,000 FHV trips in New York City per day under a single brand, trade, or operating name, referred to as High-Volume For-Hire Services (HVFHS). This law went into effect on Feb 1, 2019.
