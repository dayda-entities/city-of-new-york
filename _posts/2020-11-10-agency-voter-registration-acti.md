Section 1057-a of the New York City Charter requires certain agencies to engage in and report on voter registration activities. This dataset captures how many voter registration applications each agency has distributed, how many applications agency staff sent to the Board of Elections, how many staff each agency trained to distribute voter registration applications, whether or not the agency hosts a link to voting.nyc on its website and if so, how many clicks that link received during the reporting period. 
Some agencies distribute voter registration applications during the course of a direct interaction with a member of the public and other agencies distribute applications passively, such as making the applications available in waiting rooms. This makes it difficult in some cases to ascertain the exact number of voter registration forms distributed. Applications sent to the Board of Elections only captures those sent by agency staff. Individuals may also choose to send in the application themselves. These applications are not counted towards the total number of applications sent to the Board of Elections.
Data is reported by agencies to the Mayorâ€™s Office of Operations twice a year. The first reporting period covers January 1 to June 30; the second reporting period covers July 1 to December 31.
