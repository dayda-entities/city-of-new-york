The amount of salt DSNY dispenses from salt sites during a specific time period.

DSNY is responsible for the removal of snow and ice from all New York City highways and streets during and post snow storms. Salt usage data is collected daily during a snow event.  DSNY spreading equipment holds 16 tons of salt.The amount of salt dispensed onto roadways is calculated based on the number of times a piece of equipment is reloaded throughout a storm citywide. Each record represents amount of salt dispensed from salt sites during a specific time period. DSNY uses salt usage data for tracking, planning, and purchasing purchases.Tracking salt usage gives DSNY a clear picture of each Boroughâ€™s usage percentage of the commodity.Some decisions that can be made with this data are:
- DSNY is able to make decisions on which Borough has an increased need based on their respective usage.
- DSNY is able to make decisions on which Borough has a lesser need based on their respective usage.
- Which Borough may be in need of more salt storage facilities.
- Which Borough needs more frequent deliveries for replenishment post storm. 
At this time DSNY does not have any type of technology incorporated to track salt usage therefore there is always a chance of errors being made during data collection.
