The Social Indicators Report is an analysis of social conditions across New York City, including geographic and demographic breakdowns, changes over time, and the Mayor's plan for responding to problems highlighted in the report.

</br></p>"The Social Indicators Report is an annual report published by the Mayor's Office of Operations to provide a statistical portrait of the City and to help guide the City's efforts to reduce disparities and advance equity. The Social Indicators Report data is compiled from agency requests and census data. The records in this dataset represent current conditions in our society in a number of domains (e.g. Education, Health) and for a variety of populations (e.g. Citywide, by Borough, Race/Ethnicity, Gender). This data can be used to get a clearer understanding of current conditions in New York City, and identifying unmet needs, and areas where progress is being made. 
Local Law 177 requires the City to report data disaggregated by race, gender, income, and sexual orientation. This year's update meets that requirement wherever feasible. Data on sexual identity is not currently collected at the individual level for the indicators included in this update."
