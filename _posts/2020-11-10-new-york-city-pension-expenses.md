The dataset illustrates the breakdown of total pension expenses for New York City into three categories: City Actuarial Systems, Non-City Systems and Non-Actuarial Systems. Data is reported in units of thousands. Updates are posted semi-annually, in Financial Plan Detail for January Plan and in Message of the Mayor for Executive Plan.
