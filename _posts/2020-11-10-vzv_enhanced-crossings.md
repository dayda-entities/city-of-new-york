Enhanced Crossings are marked high-visibility crosswalks on calm streets with low vehicle volumes and a strong pedestrian desire to cross. Standard DOT toolbox treatments are used (ADA pedestrian ramps, pedestrian warning signs and high-visibility crosswalk markings) to improve the mobility and accessibility of pedestrians.
