Attendance data includes students in district 1-32, 75 (Special Education), district 79 (Alternative Schools & Programs), charter schools, home schooling.  Home and hospital instruction are excluded.  Pre-K data does not include NYC Early Education Centers or District Pre-K Centers therefore data is limited to those who attend K-12 schools that offer Pre-K.  Transfer schools are included in citywide, borough, district counts but removed from school level file.  Attendance is registered to school student is attending at the time. If a student attend multiple schools in a school year the data will be reflected in multiple schools.
