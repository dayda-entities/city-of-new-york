This dataset, formally referred to as ""Functional Parkland"" consists of park properties under the jurisdiction of NYC Parks. The shapes in this dataset are drawn to make printed maps clear and easy to read. Consequently, the shapes in this file should not be used for any spatial calculations. For non-cartographic purposes, consult https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Recreation/Parks-Properties/enfh-gkve

This dataset uses the standard NYC projection of NAD_1983_StatePlane_New_York_Long_Island_FIPS_3104_Feet. Lengths are in feet and areas in square feet.
