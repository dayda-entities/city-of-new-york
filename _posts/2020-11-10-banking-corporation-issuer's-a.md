Issuer's Allocation Percentage for all corporations subject to taxes.

These reports are used by general corporations and unincorporated taxpayers to compute their investment allocation percentages, and by general corporation taxpayers to compute their allocated subsidiary capital. For 2006 and prior, the list include only corporations whose issuer's allocation percentages are known to be less than 100%. For 2007 and later, the lists include corporations whose issuer's allocation percentages are 100% or less.
