The NYC Health + Hospitals Options is a discount payment scale that determines fees for NYC Health + Hospitals services for New Yorkers who do not qualify or cannot afford any of the free or low cost health insurance plans available. The reduced fees are based on family size and income. This data shows the minimum and maximum income levels needed to be eligible for the reduced rates in 2011.
