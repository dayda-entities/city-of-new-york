Locations and types of refuse litter baskets tracked by DSNY

Data is collected by DSNY in order to track basket locations.
Data is collected through periodic surveys by field personnel. DSNY digitizes the locations of litter baskets using GIS software.
Each record represents the approximate location, ownership, and physical type of a single refuse litter basket.
The data can be used as an approximate assessment of the locations of litter baskets tracked by the Department of Sanitation in NYC.
"Litter basket locations are subject to frequent change, for reasons that include but are not limited to: litter basket damage, nearby construction, graffiti, or regular illegal use of basket for household or commercial waste. There is often a lag time between a change in basket type or location and the reflection of that change in this dataset.

This dataset includes information of BID-owned and Privately-owned litter baskets.  Non-profit and private entities wishing to place a litter basket on a public street must receive permission from the Department of Sanitation. Location data for these baskets may be less accurate than for baskets that are owned by DSNY.

This dataset does not track public litter baskets placed by other City, State, or Federal agencies, notably including the NYC Department of Parks. Recycling baskets are also not tracked in this dataset."
