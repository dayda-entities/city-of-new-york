Inspection results.

NYC Health Code requires that building drinking water storage tanks be inspected annually and that the results of these inspections be reported to the Health Department (NYC DOHMH). To report specific inspection findings related to public safety and sanitary conditions, owners or their representatives fill out a questionnaire provided by DOHMH.  This dataset is the non-administrative subset of owner-reported information.  Reported data have not been verified by a City Agency.
