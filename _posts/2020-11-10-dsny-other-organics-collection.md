Annual tons of food scraps dropped off at Green Markets and NYC Compost Project Partners. Also includes other deliveries of organics including leaf and wood wastes to NYC Compost Project Partners.

Please note that starting on March 20, 2020, DSNY suspended some services to limit person-to-person contact and to enable our workforce to refocus on core operations. Suspended services include Food Scrap Drop-off sites. Residents should not leave food scraps at any location.
